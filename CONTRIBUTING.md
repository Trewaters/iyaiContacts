# Goals

## Why am I open sourcing this project?

Practice! PRACtice! PRACTICE! I want to get better at what I do. Part of that requires others to review and comment on it. The other part is that people use what I build so I can learn to build better widgets.

This seems like a practical tool for others to use.
